# THE-FOODIE

### Description
Our app is basically a recipe app where user can login/ signup into our Foodie website and can search for a recipe based on user name, recipe name, diet type. User can also post a new recipe through this application.

### Use cases
 - When a USER clicks on the herokuLink, he will be able to access our app
 - USER can view all the recipes on the homepage
 - If a USER wants to post a new recipe, he should signup for the first time
 - USER can login and post a new recipe too.
 - USER can log-out if he want to exit from his account.
 - USER can also select diet-type from the dropdown
 - Whenver USER selects a diet-type and click on search, he will be able to see all the recipes based on diet-type.

 ### Future plan
